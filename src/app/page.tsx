// Here, the property could display a "Settlement in Progress" status with details about the estimated completion date and any other necessary milestones (e.g., inspections, final payment).
// After all required steps in the process are marked complete, trigger an update that automatically moves the property from "Pending Settlements" to "Settled Properties" within the same "My Portfolio" section.
// Add a "Congratulations" notification or message for the user to make it feel like a significant milestone has been achieved.
